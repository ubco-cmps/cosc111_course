# Lab 1

To accept this lab on GitHub Classroom, please [click on this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/0Dk_zNST).

This lab has three tasks, they are all independent and you can do them in any order:

- Task 1: Install the Processing programming development environment (PDE)
- Task 2: Go through the install instructions for your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Task 3: Complete the GitHub Tutorial.

## Task 1: Install the JDK (12 marks)

To install the the Java SE JDK,

1. Navigate to the [Java SE JDK download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. Click the big “Java Download” button.
3. In the new page, click to accept the license agreement (just below Java SEmDevelopment Kit x” section).
4. Click to download the JDK package that works for your operating system.
5. Wait for your download to finish.
6. Run the installer and follow the directions. 
7. Be sure to accept the default settings.

## Task 2: Prepare your System (40 marks)

There are several things you need to install on your machines for this course.

- On macOS, follow the instructions [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/cosc123/class/week01/macOS.html).

- On Windows, follow the instructions [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/cosc123/class/week01/windows.html).

- On Ubuntu, follow the instructions [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/cosc123/class/week01/ubuntu.html).

Once you have gone through the installation instructions, please take a screenshot with the following requirements:

- One terminal window with the output of `git config --list --global`
- Another terminal window with the output of `code --version` and `git --version` sequentially printed'
  - If you have not yet installed the JDK, you should now go back and complete Task 1
- You should launch the Geany IDE and show us that you successfully launched the IDE
- VS Code open
- Date/time should be visible somewhere in the screenshot

Here is an example of what you should be aiming for:

### Acknowledgements

These installation instructions were heavily adapted from the ones found [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/).

## Task 3: GitHub Tutorial (48 marks)

I will be honest: Git and GitHub is a difficult thing to teach so after many years of searching, I have found the [**PERFECT** tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org).
This tutorial wil help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working in your repos.

At minimum, you are responsible for completing the following modules:

- "Main: Introduction Sequence"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  
- "Ramping up"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

- "To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes!"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

You will get 2 points for each activity, for a total of 48 points.

Once you are done, you should include a screenshot of both the exercises in "Main" and "Remotes", and also include a text file where you write your github username and the current date/time.

Here is an example of the screenshot we are expecting (if you want full marks you will have completed all 24 exercises).
