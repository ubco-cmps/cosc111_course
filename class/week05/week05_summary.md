Week 5 Summary
=======================

This week there is no new content in this course.
This week, you'll have an opportunity to catch your breath and catch up on anything from the last few weeks that you didn't have time to grasp or go through.
This may include test questions, missed homework questions, videos that you didn't watch, readings you didn't do, or anything else.
Though you don't *have to* use this break for this course, I encourage you to make sure you are actually caught up before re-purposing that time for other courses.
That being said, I understand it's midterm season so I'm sure you'll have plenty of things to fill your time with.
