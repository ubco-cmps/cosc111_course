## Lecture Activity 3 - Instructions

In lecture activity 3, we will practice writing some more Java programs

### General instructions for creating Java files

For each of the following Tasks, create a separate Java file called task1.java, task2.java, task3.java etc... 

Remember, to create a new file, first navigate to this directory locally using `cd path/to/this/repo` and then type: `code task1.java`.
This will open a new file called `task1.java` in Visual Studio Code.
You can also work in Geany, or Eclipse, it's your choice.


```
public class task1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  // Enter your code
	}
  
}
```

Don't forget to change the name of the public class method for each file!

### Task 1: Review printing

Write Java code that prints your name 6 times.

### Task 2: Exponent Table

Write Java code that displays the following table:

```
x 	x^5 	x^10
1 	1 	1
2 	32	1024
3 	243	59049
```

### Task 3: Calculate and Print Area

Write Java code that calculates and displays the area and perimeter of a circle that has a radius of 5.5 using the following formulae:

perimeter = 2 * $\pi$ * $r$
area = $\pi$ * $r$ * $r$ *.

Sample output:

```
Area: 95.0440975
Perimeter: 34.55749
```

### Task 4: Complex Calculation

Write Java code that computes the answer to this expression:

$$\frac{3 \cdot 4.5 + 5 \cdot 7.1}{7.2 \cdot 5.5}$$

### Task 5: Accepting Input

Write Java code that accepts two user inputs: **a distance in m** and the time it takes for the person to run that distance **in seconds**.
Print out the average speed of the runner.

Sample output:

```
You ran 10 m/s !
```

### Task 6: Update your README file 

If you named your files as suggested above, you do not have to do anything in this section.
If you named your files differently, please update the links below to make sure they work.

[Task 1 Java file](./task1.java)

[Task 2 Java file](./task2.java)

[Task 3 Java file](./task3.java)

[Task 4 Java file](./task4.java)

[Task 5 Java file](./task5.java)
